There are 5 departments in the university. Each department can accept limited number of students depending on their ranking (GPA).
Candidates can be accepted in one of 3 waves of admission. Students are sorted by an exam suits the particular Department or by their final exam.
If after one wave of admission some departments have vacant places, students can be accepted in the next wave.
